  <description>Despite its ridiculously low mass and its cloudy texture, this foam is extremely elastic and hard to tear, making it an excellent underlayer for a more rigid armor, making it perfect for ships that can't afford the weight of a regular battle armor underlayer. It comes at a cost, though.</description>
