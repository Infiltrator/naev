  <description>Instead of relying on more traditional armour alloys, the Nanofoam Padding uses tessellated nanotube structures to provide resilience against weapon fire. As the nanotubes lack any sort of supporting structure, it becomes necessary to attach them to another hull as an underlayer, where they will provide reactive support upon impact. The foam is extremely elastic and hard to tear, making it perfect for ships that can't afford the weight of a regular battle armour underlayer. It does come at a cost, though.</description>
